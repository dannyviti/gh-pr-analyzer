# Implementation Log: PR Reviewer Workload Analysis Feature

**Reference Plan**: [PLAN.md](PLAN.md)

## 2025-09-16

### Initial Planning and Analysis

- **16:45** - Started task analysis and requirement gathering
- **16:52** - Analyzed existing codebase structure and GitHub API integration points
- **17:05** - Researched GitHub API data sources for reviewer requests (`requested_reviewers`, `requested_teams`)
- **17:12** - Created comprehensive technical implementation plan with 5 phases
- **17:15** - Generated TODO.md with detailed task breakdown and LOG.md for tracking

### Key Findings

- GitHub API provides `requested_reviewers` and `requested_teams` fields in PR objects
- Existing system already collects PR data but doesn't capture reviewer request information
- Need to enhance data collection, add analysis engine, extend CLI, and create specialized reporting
- Current CSV reporter architecture is extensible for reviewer-focused output formats

### Next Steps

- Begin Phase 1: Enhance GitHub API data collection to capture reviewer request data
- Modify `github_client.py` to preserve `requested_reviewers` and `requested_teams` fields
- Add method to expand team memberships to individual reviewers for accurate workload tracking

## Phase 1 - 2025-09-16 17:35

## Phase 3 - 2025-09-16 19:15

### Files Modified:

- `github_pr_analyzer.py`: Added comprehensive CLI integration for reviewer analysis mode
- `test_integration.py`: Added new test class `TestReviewerAnalysisCLIIntegration` with 5 test methods

### Implementation Notes:

- Added reviewer workload analysis argument group to CLI parser with 4 new arguments:
  - `--analyze-reviewers`: Enable reviewer analysis mode instead of PR lifecycle analysis
  - `--reviewer-threshold`: Threshold for detecting overloaded reviewers (default: 10 requests)
  - `--include-teams`: Include team-based reviewer analysis with member expansion
  - `--reviewer-period`: Time period in months for reviewer analysis (defaults to --months value)
- Updated help text and examples to include reviewer analysis usage patterns
- Modified `validate_inputs()` function to validate reviewer-specific parameters
- Enhanced `generate_auto_filename()` to generate appropriate filenames for reviewer analysis mode
- Created `print_reviewer_summary()` function for comprehensive reviewer analysis output formatting
- Modified main workflow to detect reviewer analysis mode and branch execution accordingly:
  - Uses ReviewerWorkloadAnalyzer instead of PR lifecycle analysis when `--analyze-reviewers` is specified
  - Supports custom analysis periods via `--reviewer-period` argument
  - Handles team-based analysis with organization name extraction
