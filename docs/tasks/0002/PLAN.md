# Technical Implementation Plan: PR Reviewer Workload Analysis Feature

## Task Description

Add the ability to analyze and report on PR reviewer workloads to identify if groups of people are being overloaded with
review requests. This feature will track who is being asked to review PRs (via `requested_reviewers` and
`requested_teams`), aggregate this data over time, and generate reports showing reviewer request distribution and
potential overload situations.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: GitHub API Data Collection Enhancement

**Implementation:**

- Modify `github_client.py` to capture `requested_reviewers` and `requested_teams` from PR data
- Add method `get_pr_requested_reviewers()` to fetch current reviewer requests for a PR
- Ensure reviewer request data is preserved in existing PR data collection workflows
- Add handling for team reviewer expansion (get individual members from teams)

**Tests:**

- Unit tests for reviewer data extraction from GitHub API responses
- Tests for team member resolution and expansion
- Tests for handling missing or null reviewer data
- Tests for API error handling in reviewer data collection

### Phase 2: Reviewer Workload Analysis Engine

**Implementation:**

- Create `reviewer_analyzer.py` module with `ReviewerWorkloadAnalyzer` class
- Add methods to aggregate reviewer requests across multiple PRs
- Add statistical analysis to identify reviewer overload patterns
- Add methods to calculate reviewer request frequency, distribution, and trends
- Add detection logic for reviewer bottlenecks and imbalances

**Tests:**

- Unit tests for reviewer request aggregation and counting
- Tests for overload detection algorithms and thresholds
- Tests for statistical calculations (averages, percentiles, etc.)
- Tests for edge cases (reviewers with zero requests, team vs individual analysis)

### Phase 3: CLI Integration and Workflow Orchestration

**Implementation:**

- Extend `github_pr_analyzer.py` with new command-line arguments:
  - `--analyze-reviewers` flag to enable reviewer analysis mode
  - `--reviewer-threshold` to set overload detection threshold
  - `--include-teams` to include team-based analysis
  - `--reviewer-period` to specify analysis time period
- Modify main workflow to support reviewer analysis pipeline
- Add reviewer-specific logging and progress reporting

**Tests:**

- CLI argument parsing tests for new reviewer options
- Integration tests for reviewer analysis workflow
- Tests for combining reviewer analysis with existing PR metrics
- Tests for error handling and user feedback in reviewer mode

### Phase 4: Enhanced CSV Reporting for Reviewer Data

**Implementation:**

- Extend `CSVReporter` class to support reviewer workload output formats
- Add new CSV structure showing reviewer request counts and distribution
- Add summary statistics for reviewer workload analysis
- Include overload indicators and recommendations in output
- Add support for team-based vs individual reviewer reporting

**Tests:**

- Unit tests for reviewer-focused CSV output format
- Tests for reviewer workload summary statistics
- Tests for CSV validation with reviewer analysis data
- Tests for team vs individual reviewer report formats

### Phase 5: Advanced Analytics and Reporting Features

**Implementation:**

- Add time-based reviewer workload trending analysis
- Add reviewer request pattern detection (frequent collaborators, etc.)
- Add visualization-friendly data export for reviewer metrics
- Add configurable overload thresholds and alerting
- Add reviewer diversity and distribution analysis

**Tests:**

- Tests for time-series analysis of reviewer requests
- Tests for pattern detection algorithms
- Tests for configurable threshold handling
- Integration tests covering advanced analytics workflows

## Detailed Technical Changes

### Command Line Interface Changes

New arguments for `github_pr_analyzer.py`:

```bash
python github_pr_analyzer.py owner/repo --analyze-reviewers
python github_pr_analyzer.py owner/repo --analyze-reviewers --reviewer-threshold 10
python github_pr_analyzer.py owner/repo --analyze-reviewers --include-teams --output reviewer_analysis.csv
```

### New Data Structures

**Reviewer Request Tracking:**

- Track individual reviewer request counts per user
- Track team reviewer request counts per team
- Track reviewer request trends over time periods
- Track reviewer response patterns and timing

**Overload Detection:**

- Configurable thresholds for "high" vs "excessive" reviewer loads
- Statistical analysis comparing individual loads to repository averages
- Detection of reviewer request distribution imbalances

### GitHub API Data Enhancement

**Enhanced PR data collection to include:**

- `requested_reviewers[]` - Individual users requested to review
- `requested_teams[]` - Teams requested to review (with member expansion)
- Request timestamps and duration tracking
- Correlation with actual review completion

### New CSV Output Format

The reviewer analysis mode will generate CSV with:

- Individual reviewer request counts and frequencies
- Team reviewer request counts and member distribution
- Overload indicators and threshold comparisons
- Time-period analysis and trending data
- Repository averages and distribution statistics

### Data Flow Changes

1. **Standard Mode**: Repository → All PRs → Aggregate Metrics → CSV
2. **Reviewer Mode**: Repository → All PRs → Extract Reviewer Requests → Aggregate by Reviewer → Overload Analysis →
   Reviewer CSV

### API Extensions

**New methods in `GitHubClient`:**

- `get_pr_requested_reviewers(owner, repo, pr_number)` - Get current reviewer requests
- `expand_team_members(team_slug)` - Get individual members of requested teams

**New class `ReviewerWorkloadAnalyzer`:**

- `aggregate_reviewer_requests(prs)` - Count requests per reviewer across PRs
- `detect_reviewer_overload(reviewer_data, threshold)` - Identify overloaded reviewers
- `calculate_reviewer_statistics(reviewer_data)` - Generate summary statistics
- `analyze_reviewer_distribution(reviewer_data)` - Analyze request distribution patterns

**New methods in `PRAnalyzer`:**

- `extract_reviewer_requests(prs)` - Extract all reviewer request data from PRs
- `get_reviewer_workload_summary(prs)` - Generate reviewer workload overview

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Each new method will have comprehensive unit tests with mock GitHub API responses
- Edge case coverage for reviewers with zero requests, missing data, team handling
- Statistical calculation accuracy tests for overload detection algorithms

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end tests for complete reviewer analysis workflow
- CLI integration tests for new command-line arguments and options
- CSV output validation tests for reviewer-focused reports

### Functional Tests

- Test complete reviewer overload detection scenarios with realistic data
- Verify accuracy of reviewer request counting and aggregation
- Test team vs individual reviewer analysis accuracy
- Test error handling and user feedback for reviewer analysis edge cases

## Success Criteria

1. System can track and count review requests for individual users across all PRs
2. System can identify potentially overloaded reviewers based on configurable thresholds
3. CSV reports clearly show reviewer workload distribution and overload indicators
4. Team-based reviewer requests are properly expanded to show individual member impact
5. CLI provides clear options for reviewer analysis with appropriate help text
6. All existing PR analysis functionality remains unchanged and working
7. Comprehensive test coverage for reviewer analysis features
8. Performance remains acceptable even with large numbers of PRs and reviewers
