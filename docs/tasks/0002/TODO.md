- [x] Write unit tests for reviewer data extraction from API responses
- [x] Write unit tests for team member resolution and expansion
- [x] Write unit tests for handling missing reviewer data
- [x] Write unit tests for API error handling in reviewer data collection

## Phase 2: Reviewer Workload Analysis Engine

- [x] Create new file `reviewer_analyzer.py`
- [x] Implement `ReviewerWorkloadAnalyzer` class with initialization
- [x] Add `aggregate_reviewer_requests()` method to count requests per reviewer
- [x] Add `detect_reviewer_overload()` method with configurable thresholds
- [x] Add `calculate_reviewer_statistics()` method for summary metrics
- [x] Add `analyze_reviewer_distribution()` method for pattern analysis
- [x] Implement statistical calculations (averages, percentiles, distributions)
- [x] Add reviewer bottleneck and imbalance detection logic
- [x] Write unit tests for reviewer request aggregation and counting
- [x] Write unit tests for overload detection algorithms and thresholds
- [x] Write unit tests for statistical calculations accuracy
- [x] Write unit tests for edge cases (zero requests, team vs individual)

## Phase 3: CLI Integration and Workflow Orchestration

- [x] Add `--analyze-reviewers` flag to `github_pr_analyzer.py` argument parser
- [x] Add `--reviewer-threshold` argument for overload detection threshold
- [x] Add `--include-teams` argument to include team-based analysis
- [x] Add `--reviewer-period` argument for analysis time period specification
- [x] Modify main workflow in `github_pr_analyzer.py` to support reviewer analysis
- [x] Add reviewer-specific logging and progress reporting
- [x] Integrate `ReviewerWorkloadAnalyzer` with existing `PRAnalyzer`
- [x] Add reviewer analysis mode validation and input checking
- [x] Write CLI argument parsing tests for new reviewer options
- [x] Write integration tests for reviewer analysis workflow
- [x] Write tests for combining reviewer analysis with existing PR metrics
- [x] Write tests for error handling and user feedback in reviewer mode

## Phase 4: Enhanced CSV Reporting for Reviewer Data

- [x] Extend `CSVReporter` class with reviewer workload output support
- [x] Add `_format_reviewer_csv_headers()` method for reviewer-specific columns
- [x] Add `_format_reviewer_csv_rows()` method for reviewer data formatting
- [x] Add `generate_reviewer_report()` method for reviewer-focused CSV generation
- [x] Add reviewer workload summary statistics to CSV header comments
- [x] Include overload indicators and recommendations in CSV output
- [x] Add support for team-based vs individual reviewer reporting formats
- [x] Add data validation for reviewer analysis CSV structure
- [x] Write unit tests for reviewer-focused CSV output format
- [x] Write unit tests for reviewer workload summary statistics
- [x] Write unit tests for CSV validation with reviewer analysis data
- [x] Write unit tests for team vs individual reviewer report formats

## Phase 5: Advanced Analytics and Reporting Features

- [ ] Add time-based reviewer workload trending analysis
- [ ] Add reviewer request pattern detection (frequent collaborators, etc.)
- [ ] Add visualization-friendly data export for reviewer metrics
- [ ] Add configurable overload thresholds and alerting mechanisms
- [ ] Add reviewer diversity and distribution analysis features
- [ ] Add reviewer response time correlation with request volume
- [ ] Add repository comparison capabilities for reviewer workloads
- [ ] Implement advanced statistical analysis (outlier detection, clustering)
- [ ] Write tests for time-series analysis of reviewer requests
- [ ] Write tests for pattern detection algorithms
- [ ] Write tests for configurable threshold handling
- [ ] Write integration tests covering advanced analytics workflows

## Documentation and Quality Assurance

- [ ] Update `README.md` with reviewer analysis feature documentation
- [ ] Add reviewer analysis examples to CLI help text
- [ ] Create reviewer analysis usage examples and scenarios
- [ ] Add error message documentation for reviewer analysis failure cases
- [ ] Update existing docstrings to mention reviewer analysis capabilities
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing with real repository data
- [ ] Validate performance with large-scale reviewer datasets

## Integration and Deployment

- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing analysis workflows
- [ ] Test reviewer analysis with various repository sizes and structures
- [ ] Validate memory usage and performance with large reviewer datasets
- [ ] Test CSV output compatibility with common spreadsheet applications
- [ ] Verify proper handling of GitHub API rate limits during reviewer analysis
- [ ] Test error recovery and graceful degradation scenarios
- [ ] Create integration test scenarios covering edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Validate reviewer analysis accuracy against manual verification
